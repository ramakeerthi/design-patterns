The Strategy Pattern:

    Defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangable.
    ** Strategy lets the algo vary independently form the clients that use them.

    Ex: In the SimuDuck application, if we inherit the behaviours, it would be cumbersome to 
    override or add different implementations to fly/quack behaviours.
